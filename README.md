# Generating-Medical-Images-with-Generative-Adversarial-Network
Because medical image data is scarce, generative models can expand
the dataset and generate images of specific requirements, and learn a distributional representation
of the data. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is chosen as the generative model, because
GAN, compared with other generative models, only use back-propagation, clearer and more realistic
samples can be generated from random latent variables and can be trained through unsupervised
learning. This is the HW4 of ECE 285 at UC San Diego.
